# GitHub 

When working on a report or a project, it is often the case that you keep separate versions either to keep track of the changes (in case you want to go back to a previous version) or to have a version for each person working on different parts of the project. As a result of this approach, you may have experienced a moment like this[^1] at least once in your life:

In these cases, after having modified and changed different parts of a report, you probably find yourself saving the same file over and over again while losing track of what changes you made. To respond to this problem, software has been developed to keep track of your changes by informing you on the saves you made and allowing you to go back to previous versions in order to revert those changes. This software is generally called "version control" and this chapter discusses the features of this software as well as introducing a specific version control platform called "GitHub". The latter includes a series of highly useful tools that can be extremely helpful, not only for the projects developed based on this book, but also for any personal or collaborative project you may undertake in the future. 

Below is a video explaining some of the benefits of using GitHub.

## Version Control 

As mentioned above, *version control* is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files in order to keep track and possibly revert to or modify those changes over time. More specifically, it allows you to: 

- record the entire history of a file;
- revert to a specific version of the file;
- collaborate on the same platform with other people;
- make changes without modifying the main file and add them once you feel comfortable with them. 

All these features are highly important when projects start becoming more complex and/or different collaborators contribute to it. In the next section we present a version control platform called "GitHub" that is commonly used among programmers and software developers thereby allowing them also to make their work visible and available to the general public. 

## Git and GitHub

Among the different version control platforms, Git is a commonly used and powerful tool that is made more accessible through GitHub which is a commercial website. The latter uses the Git platform and stores local files into a flexible folder called a "repository". For the purposes of this course, we will be using this platform and in the following sections we will briefly describe how to install and get started with this version control platform.


### Git Setup 

To install Git, go to the [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and select the version which is compatible with the OS of your computer (e.g. Windows/Mac/Linux/Solaris). Once you've downloaded and installed Git, the first thing you should do is to configure it by setting your username and email address. This is important because each time you interact with the platform and upload (commit) your changes to Git, this information is used to synchronize versions and keep track of project evolution. 

ROB COMMENT: Justin, explain:
what the configuration is for (in some more detail) *check* 
where and how these configuration instructions below are entered *check* 

#### Tell Git Who You Are

Once you have installed Git, run the `Git Bash` software and type the following code below. 

```
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

This is the initial configuration of your author name and email address for your commits. You may need to do this before you begin pushing and pulling with your current account information. This operation only needs to be done once if using the "--global" option because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the "--global" option while working on those projects.

Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.

ROB COMMENT: Justin, 
above explain what "GUI" stands for and what it is. Give more details on this and how it can be used
explain why it is important to use GitHub which is introduced in the next section


### GitHub Setup 

In order to set up GitHub, go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and, for the purposes of the course, the first step is to sign up with your PSU email address.

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Your username and email can be changed at any time so, if you want to change it, you can easily do so once this course is over.
```

Once this is done, you reach `Step 2: Choose your plan` where you can choose the default plan ("Unlimited public repositories for free") and click `Continue`. The last (optional) step is `Step 3: Tailor your experience` which allows you to submit your information but this can also be skipped. 

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
Your GitHub profile can also serve as a *resume* of your data science skills that will be highlighted by possilbe future projects that you save and commit.
```

After you have set up your profile, make sure you verify your email address and, for the purposes of evaluating your performance in this course, send us your GitHub user ID (eg. jjl170) to `jjl170@psu.edu`. 

### Student Developer Pack

As a student, it is possible to benefit from specific advantages when using GitHub. Indeed, once you have set up your profile you can go to this [link](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) and follow the steps below to set up a "student developer pack" discount request to GitHub. Through this setup it will be possible for you not only to have free *public* repositories but also to make your own *private* repositories for free.

JUSTIN COMMENT: I will add a tutorial to how to submit your homework and assignments using GitHub.

| Command                        | Function                                      |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| git init                       | Create a **local** repository                 |
| git status                     | List all the files that you have modified     |
| git add -A                     | Add **all** files to staging                  |
