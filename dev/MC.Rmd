## Problem: antithetic sampling

As we saw in the previous sections, "plain" Monte Carlo integration typically has an error variance of the form $\sigma^2/B$ (in the case of the estimator we consider previously we have $\sigma^2 = (b-a)I_2 - I^2$). Therefore, to improve our answer we can sample with a larger value of $B$, but this comes at the cost of a greater computational cost. Sometimes, we can find ways to $\sigma^2$ instead by modifying our estimator of $I$. Methods to do this are known as variance reduction techniques, one them is know as **antithetic sampling**. Th
