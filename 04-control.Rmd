# Control Flow {#control}

## Introduction

When you are building a larger program than the examples we considered previously, we need use various **control structures** to control the "flow" of our actions. Essentially, a control structure is "block" of code that analyzes variables and chooses a direction in which to go based on given parameters. These pieces of code represent the most basic decision-making process in computing. There exist essentially two kinds of control structures. The first ones allow to assess whether a given condition is satisfied and take appropriate in response. A simple analogy to our day to day life would be "**if** it raining outside **then** take an umbrella", we will come back to this example later in this chapter. The second kind of control structures allow to repeat of a block code multiple times. For example such approach can be used to convert a color image to gray-scale by applying the same operation(s) (i.e. same code) to each pixel of the image. In this chapter, we will first discuss the two kind control structures previously mentioned and then present various example to build our intuition.

<!-- Just like in our daily life, we need to place conditions in which we manipulate our behavior. Statistical programming also fundamentally works in the same way. We program specific behaviors for the program to follow to obtain the statistics that we may need for various tasks like regression and bootstrapping. -->


## Selection Operators

Suppose that we are interested in creating a simple code to check if it rained in last hour and this is the case to let us decide that we should probably take an umbrella today. To write such a code we essentially need three things:

1) Find out how much it rained in the last hour at our location. Such information is now easily accessible through various websites and we can for example used the R package `rwunderground` to access this information. Note that you will need to create an account and request an API key before being able to use it (see [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rwunderground/rwunderground.pdf) for more details). Then, the precipitation amount (in inch) in the last hour can be retrieve using the code below: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rwunderground)
(rain <- conditions(set_location(zip_code = "16802"), message = FALSE)$precip_1hr)
```

2) Construct a logical (or Boolean) variable created from the variable `rain` to assess whether or a umbrella is need. For example we could judged that there was any water in the last hour we should take an umbrella. This can be done as in the code below and in Section \@ref(logical_operators) we will discuss how to construct logical variables in more details.

```{r}
(umbrella <- rain > 0)
```

3) Finally, we need to selection operator based on the logical variable constructed in the previous step to bring everything together. For example, we could the `if/else` statement presented below. This simple code will print "*You should probably take an umbrella*" if the logical variable `umbrella` is `TRUE` and print "*An umbrella is probably not necessary*", otherwise.

```{r}
if (umbrella){
  print("You should probably take an umbrella")
}else{
  print("An umbrella is probably not necessary")
}
```


### Logical Operators {#sec_logical}

Logical operators are used very commonly used in programming to create (or return) logical (Boolean) variables. In general, logical operations take place by comparing one or more variables following specific rules. The table summarizes the commonly used logical operators:

| Command     | Description                |   Example                           |    Result                             |
|-------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| x `>` y     | x greater than y           | `4 > 3`                             | `r 4 > 3`                             |
| x `>=` y    | x greater or equals to y   | `1 >= 1`                            | `r 1 >= 1`                            |
| x `<` y     | x less than y              | `c(12 < 20, 1 < 1)`                 | `r c(12 < 20, 1 < 1)`                 |
| x `<=` y    | x less than or equals to y | `12 <= 1`                           | `r 12 <= 1`                           |
| x `==` y    | x equal to y               | `c(2 == 2, 1 == 2)`                 | `r c(2 == 2, 1 == 2)`                 |
| x `!=` y    | x not equal to y           | `c(2 != 2, F != T)`                 | `r c(2 != 2, FALSE != TRUE)`          |
| `!`x        | Not x                      | `c(!(2 > 1), !FALSE)`               | `r c(!(2 > 1), !FALSE)`               |
| x `|| `y    | x or y (not vectorized)    | `(1 > 1) || (2 < 3)`                | `r (1 > 1) || (2 < 3)`                |
| x `| `y     | x or y (vectorized)        | `c(1 > 1, F) || c(T, 2 < 3)`        | `r c(1 > 1, F) || c(T, 2 < 3)`        |
| x `&&` y    | x and y (not vectorized)   | `TRUE && TRUE`                      | `r TRUE && TRUE`                      |
| x `&` y     | x and y (vectorized)       | `c(TRUE, T) & c(TRUE, F)`           | `r c(TRUE, T) & c(TRUE, F)`           |
| xor(x,y)    | test if only one is TRUE   | `xor(TRUE, TRUE)`                   | `r xor(TRUE, TRUE)`                   |
| `all`(x)    | test if all are TRUE       |  `all(c(T, F, F))`                  | `r all(c(T, F, F))`                   |
| `any`(x)    | test if one or more is TRUE|  `any(c(T, F, F))`                  | `r any(c(T, F, F))`                   |


```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
There is subtle difference between `||`and `|` (or `&&` and `&`). Indeed, when using `x && y` or `x || y` it implicitely assumed that `x` and `y`are of length 1 and when there are applied to vectors **only the first elements** of each vectors will be considered. For example, `c(TRUE,FALSE) || c(FALSE, FALSE)` is equivalent to `TRUE || FALSE` and will only return `TRUE`. On the other hand, `&` and `|` can be applied to vectors and `c(TRUE,FALSE) || c(FALSE, FALSE)` is equivalent to `c(TRUE || FALSE, FALSE || FALSE)` and will return `TRUE FALSE`. It is also worth mentionning that `TRUE | c(FALSE, FALSE)` is equivalent to `c(TRUE || FALSE, TRUE || FALSE)` (i.e. the `TRUE` is used twice) and will return `TRUE TRUE`. These differences are common source of bugs. 
```

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
When using `&` or `|` to create/return logical variables we have to aware of something called **short-circuit evaluation** which can create bugs that may be difficult to find. Indeed, suppose that we interested using an expression such `x & y` and that the variable `x` is `FALSE` then `y` will not evaluated. The idea behind this evaluation is that regardless of the value of `y` the expression `x & y` should be `TRUE`. However, this implicitely assumes that `y` does not contain any mistakes and if this were to happend this could create bugs that will be hard to find. For example, consider the expression `y = x && 2 == NULL`, then if `x` is `FALSE` `y` will be `FALSE` while if `x` is `TRUE` `y` will be `NA`, which obviously is likely to be problematic. Similarly, when considering an expression such as `x | y` the variable `y` will only be evaluated if `x` is `FALSE`.

<!--
```{r}
x = c(3,6,3,4,5)
y = c(2,3,4,5,6)
x>y
```

This method outputs a vector of boolean TRUE and FALSE values that perform element-wise comparisons. Note, this is called a vectorized method, which we will further mention in more details later. `isTRUE()` checks if all the elements within the object is `TRUE`. 

```{r}
isTRUE(TRUE)
isTRUE(x>y)
```

### Selection Operators 

SMALL INTRO MISSING! 

#### `if` Statements

The most basic selection operator is called an `if` statement. Essentially, an `if` statement tells R to do a certain task for a certain case. In plain English it would correspond to something like, "If this is true, do that" or as in our motivation example "If it rains take an umbrella". In R, you would say:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (<this is TRUE>){
  <do that>
}
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (<it rains>){
  <take an umbrella>
}
```

In general, we can represent an `if` statement using the following diagram:

<center>
![](images/if.png)
</center>

The `<conditon>` denotes a **logical** variable that is used determine if the code inside of `{ }` will be evaluated. For example, if `<condition>` is `FALSE` then our program will run `Code block A` and then `Code block C`. On the other hand, if `<condition>` is `TRUE` our program will run `Code block A`, `Code block B` and finally `Code block C`.

Below we present two examples where two `if` statements are used. In the first example, we use an `if` statement to compute the absolute value of a variable called `x`:

```{r}
x <- 4

if (x < 0){
  x <- -x
}

x
```

Now we change `x` to a negative value:

```{r}
x <- -4

if (x < 0){
  x <- -x
}

x
```

In the second example, we use an `if` statement to assess `x` is an even number and if this is the case we print a simple message.

```{r}
if (x %% 2 == 0){
  print(paste(x, "is an even number"))
}
```

```{r}
x <- 3

if (x %% 2 == 0){
  print(paste(x, "is an even number"))
}
```


#### `if/else` Statements

Often when we write a program we want to tell R what to do when our condition is `TRUE` and also what to do when it is `FALSE`. Of course, we could do something like:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (condition){
  plan A
}

if (!condition){
  plan B
}
```

However, the above syntax is somewhat clumsy and one generally prefers to use an `if/else` statement. In plain English it would correspond to something like, "If this is true, then do plan A otherwise do plan B". In R we would write:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (condition){
  plan A
}else{
  plan B
}
```

Similarly to an `if` statement, we can represent an `if/else` statement using the diagram below:

<center>
![](images/ifelse.png)
</center>

Therefore, when `<condition>` is `TRUE` our program will run `Code block A`, `Code block B` and then `Code block D` while when `<condition>` is `FALSE` will run `Code block A`, `Code block B` and finally `Code block D`. Using this new tool we can revist our previous example on even numbers to include an custum message in the case of an odd number. This can be done as follows:

```{r}
x <- 2

if (x %% 2 == 0){
  print(paste(x, "is an even number"))
}else{
  print(paste(x, "is an odd number"))
}
```

```{r}
x <- 3

if (x %% 2 == 0){
  print(paste(x, "is an even number"))
}else{
  print(paste(x, "is an odd number"))
}
```
