<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This book is currently under development and has been designed as a support for students who are following (or are interested in) courses that provide the basic knowledge to master “statistical programming”. By the latter we mean that area of computer programming which focuses on the implementation of methods that not only manage data but also extract meaningful information from it. The importance of this area of research comes from the increased collection of data from different sources such as academic research, public institutions and private companies that has required a corresponding increase in data management and analysis tools. Consequently, the need to develop applications and methods that are able to deliver these tools has brought to a surge in the demand for expertise not only in computer programming but also in statistical and numerical analysis. Indeed, while it is essential to master the basics of programming to build the necessary software, it is now also paramount to understand the programming tools that can effectively respond to the need of finding, extracting and analysing the information to achieve the required goals.</p>
<p>Within the above framework, the statistical software <code>R</code> has seen a rise in use due to its flexibility as an efficient language that builds a bridge between software development and data analysis. There are of course many other programming languages that have different advantages over <code>R</code> but, as explained further on, the latter is able to develop and quickly adapt to the different needs coming from the data management and analysis community while at the same time making use of other languages in order to deliver computationally efficient solutions (as well as other interesting features described below). With this premise, this book intends to present the basic tools to statistical programming and software development using the wide variety of tools made available through <code>R</code>, from method-specific packages to version control programs. The general goals of the book are therefore the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>understand data structures in order to manage data, computer memory and computations in an appropriate manner;</li>
<li>manipulate data structures through controls, instructions and tailored functions in order to achieve the desired output;</li>
<li>create software platforms (packages and web applications) that collect the developed functions in order to respond to a certain need;</li>
<li>learn how to manage software development via version control tools (GitHub) and create documentation for this software (with embedded code) to allow others to make use of the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these goals are common to any basic programming course, however all these will be heavily focused on the use and development of statistical tools. In fact, as highlighted earlier, it has become increasingly important to include statistical methodologies within the programming framework thereby allowing software to not only manage data efficiently but also to extract and analyse data in an appropriate manner while doing so. The rest of this introductory chapter will present the R software by explaining why it is used for this book and describing the basic notations and tools that need to be known in order to better grasp its contents.</p>
<p>Once the reader has finished this book, they should be able to:</p>

<div id="r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> <code>R</code> and <code>RStudio</code></h2>
<p>The statistical computing language <code>R</code> has now become a widely used software in academia and industry. Having started as an open-source language to make available different statistics and analytical tools to researchers and the public, it steadily developed into one of the major software languages which not only allows to develop up-to-date, sound and flexible analytical tools but also to include these tools within a platform which is well integrated with other important programming languages, communication and version-control features. The latter is also possible thanks to the development of the <code>RStudio</code> interface which provides a pleasant and functional user-interface for <code>R</code> as well as an efficient Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in which different programming languages, web-applications and other important tools are available to the user.</p>
<div id="why-r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Why <code>R</code>?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to use <code>R</code> nowadays, the first of which is the fact that is a free and open-source software which <em>per se</em> does not necessarily imply that it is a good software (although it is also that). The reason why this is an important feature consists in the fact that the results of any code or program developed in the <code>R</code> environment can easily be replicated therefore ensuring accessibility and transparency for the general user. More importantly however, this replicability of results is also accompanied by a wide variety of packages that are made available through the <code>R</code> environment in which users can find a diversity of codes, functions and features that are designed to tackle a large amount of programming and analytical tasks. Moreover, these packages are relatively simple to create and are extremely useful for code-sharing purposes since they enclose the codes, functions and external dependencies that allow anyone to install any of these features all at once in easy and efficient manner.</p>
<p>In addition to its accessibility and code-sharing features, <code>R</code> has acquired visibility and importance mainly due to the cutting-edge tools that it makes available to the general user. Indeed, a growing area of research both in academia and in industry is Statistics and Machine Learning through which it is possible to find, extract and make an efficient use of the increasing amount of data and information being collected. All the latest methods and approaches going from data-mining techniques to predictive analysis are available in <code>R</code> and, due to its nature, all future methods and approaches will be made available to all users through <code>R</code>. For this reason, any individual, company or organization has a keen interest in acquiring and developing expertise in <code>R</code> since it makes available the most appropriate tools for any data-based analysis and decision-making process.</p>
<p>Like any other software, there are of course some drawbacks with using <code>R</code>. Firstly, the presence of an extended amount of user-contributed packages can make its usage and bug-reporting problematic. Although this does not represent a major problem since many forums exist and solutions are usually quickly fixed, there can be many issues concerning package updates or deletions that can create problems for other existing packages that depend on them. Despite this being rare, there can consequently be problems in the use of packages that become obsolete and need to be fixed due to these different dependency issues. Another drawback consists in the extensive use of computer memory that <code>R</code> entails through its commands which generally give little relevance to this issue. However, many different solutions are being developed which deal with this problem along with the increased memory made available by current operating systems.</p>
<p>In the perspective of improving the usage of computer memory, <code>R</code> has been developing efficient and “seemless” connections with high-performance languages which allow functions and packages to make use of them thereby greatly lightening and accelerating computations made through <code>R</code>. An important example of this is given by the connections made available to the <code>C++</code> language. In this book we will discuss the connections with this language that are particularly well implemented, but other high-performance languages can be used such as <code>C</code> and <code>FORTRAN</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-started-with-r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Getting started with R</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>R</code> can be thought of as a programming language as well as a software environment for statistical programming. Since it is a free and open-source software, all you you will need to do to install it is to download it from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a> .</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded and installed <code>R</code> on your computer you will be able to start using the programming language and packages that the <code>R</code> environment provides. Nevertheless, to make full use of the latest developments and features of this software, in this book we recommend using the IDE called <code>RStudio</code> which can be downloaded from the following link:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> are we missing something here?</p>
</div>
<div id="about-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> About RStudio</h3>
<p><strong>Matt</strong> would you have something we could use here? <strong>Justin</strong> what about a video here to introduce RStudio???</p>
<p>We should add a link to the RStudio “<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf">cheatsheet</a>”</p>
<p>Powerful tools for communicating results (Rmarkdown, shinny)</p>
</div>
<div id="conventions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Conventions</h3>
<p>Throughout this book, <code>R</code> code will be typeset using a <code>monospace</code> font which is syntax highlighted. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">a =<span class="st"> </span>pi
b =<span class="st"> </span><span class="fl">0.5</span>
<span class="kw">sin</span>(a*b)</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, <code>R</code> output lines, which would appear in your console will begin with <code>##</code> will not be syntax highlighted. The output of the above is given by:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] 1</code></pre>
<p>Maybe we should add something about the boxes we are using… Rob what do you think?</p>
</div>
<div id="simple-calculations" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Simple calculations</h3>
<p>In this section, we present how simple calculations can be made in R. In the table below we show a few examples where the first column show a mathematical epxression, the second the equivalence of this expression in R and finally in the third its result.</p>

<div id="getting-help" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Getting help</h3>
<p>In the previous section, we presented some examples on how R can be used a calculator and we have already seen several functions such as <code>sqrt()</code> or <code>log()</code>. To obtain documentation about a function in R, simply put a question mark in front of the function name and its documentation will be displayed. For example, if you are interested about learning about the function <code>log()</code> you simply type:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">?<span class="kw">log</span>()</code></pre></div>
<p>which will display something similar to:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/example-log-help.png" />

</div>
<p>Frequently one of the most difficult things to do when learning R is asking for help. First, you need to decide to ask for help, then you need to know how to ask for help. Your very first line of defense should be to Google your error message or a short description of your issue. (The ability to solve problems using this method is quickly becoming an extremely valuable skill.) If that fails, and it eventually will, you should ask for help. There are a number of things you should include when emailing an instructor, or posting to a help website such as Stack Exchange.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-packages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.7</span> Installing packages</h3>
<p><code>R</code> comes with a number of built-in functions but one its main strengths is that there is a large numbers of packages that you can install. These packages add additional functions, features and data to the R environement. If you want to something in <code>R</code> which is not available by default, there is a good chance that there is packages that will do what you want.</p>
<p><code>R</code> packages can be installed in various ways but in this section we will only discuss the most straightforward approach to do so, which is through the <code>install.packages()</code> function. In Chapter ????? (github) we will see other ways of installing packages. The use of the <code>install.packages()</code> is quite simple, for example if you want to install the package <code>devtools</code> you can simply write:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.packages</span>(devtools)</code></pre></div>
<p>Once a package is installed, you will have to “load” it into your current <code>R</code> session before being able to used it. This is generally done with the function <code>library()</code> and for example with the <code>devtools</code> package you would write:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(devtools)</code></pre></div>
<p>Once you close <code>R</code>, all packages will closed and you will have to load them again but you don’t have to install packages again.</p>
</div>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Basic Probability and Statistics with R</h2>
<div id="probability-distributions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Probability Distributions</h3>
<p>For probability distributions, we can compute basic values such as density, distribution, quantiles, random sampling using <code>R</code> built-in functions below.</p>
<p>-<code>dname</code> calculates density (pdf) at input <code>x</code>. -<code>pname</code> calculates distribution (cdf) at input <code>x</code>. -<code>qname</code> calculates the quantile at an input probability. -<code>rname</code> generates a random draw from a particular distribution.</p>
<p>Note that we will replace <code>name</code> with the name of a given distribution. For example, a a random number generator for uniform distribution will be <code>runif</code>. To learn more about specific parameters and documentation for a function, type <code>?</code> before the function name into your <code>R</code> console. Common example probability distributions include, but are not limited to, binomial, chi-square, exponential, F, geometric, logistic, normal, poisson, t, and uniform.</p>
<p>Here’s an example.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Assume that the test scores of a college entrance exam fits a normal distribution. Furthermore, the mean test score is 70, and the standard deviation is 15. What is the percentage of students scoring 90 or more in the exam?</p>
</div>
<div id="answer" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>In this case, we consider a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that is normally distributed <span class="math inline">\(X \sim N(\mu=70, \sigma^2=25)\)</span>. Since we are looking for the percentage of students scoring higher than 90, we are interested in the upper tail of the normal distribution.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">pnorm</span>(<span class="dt">q =</span> <span class="dv">90</span>, <span class="dt">mean =</span> <span class="dv">70</span>, <span class="dt">sd =</span> <span class="dv">15</span>, <span class="dt">lower.tail =</span> <span class="ot">FALSE</span>) </code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.09121122</code></pre>
<p>We see that there is a 9% probability of students scoring 90 or more in the exam. Note that at <code>?pnorm</code> we see an additional parameter, <code>lower.tail</code> that indicates TRUE (default) if probabilities are P[X ≤ x] and FALSE otherwise, where P[X &gt; x].</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> Factor Input</h3>
<p>For factor input, we can extract counts and percentages as summary by using <code>table</code>.</p>
<p>Here I create an example dataset with colors 20 that are <code>Yellow</code>, 10 that are <code>Green</code> and 50 that are <code>Blue</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">(<span class="dt">my_colors =</span> <span class="kw">as.factor</span>(<span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Yellow&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">20</span>), <span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Green&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>), <span class="kw">rep</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Blue&quot;</span>, <span class="dv">50</span>))))</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow
## [11] Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow Yellow
## [21] Green  Green  Green  Green  Green  Green  Green  Green  Green  Green 
## [31] Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue  
## [41] Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue

## [61] Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue  
## [71] Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue   Blue  
## Levels: Blue Green Yellow</code></pre>
<p>By using <code>table</code> we can see a frequency (count) table of the colors.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">table</span>(my_colors)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## my_colors
##   Blue  Green Yellow 
##     50     10     20</code></pre>
<p>By diving the table by the number of total colors, we can get percentages instead.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">table</span>(my_colors) /<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">length</span>(my_colors)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## my_colors
##   Blue  Green Yellow 
##  0.625  0.125  0.250</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="dataset" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.5</span> Dataset</h3>
<p>For some datasets, there is another convenient way to get simple summary statistics.</p>
<p>In this example, we will explore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set">Iris</a> flower dataset contained in the <code>R</code> built-in <code>datasets</code> package. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.</p>
<p>We can use <code>summary</code> to output the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum statistics, and frequency counts for factor inputs.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">summary</span>(iris)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   
##  Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  
##  1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  
##  Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  
##  Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  
##  3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  
##  Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  
##        Species  
##  setosa    :50  
##  versicolor:50  
##  virginica :50  
##                 
##                 
## </code></pre>
<p>We can also <code>str</code> to get a basic feel for what the dataset looks like, in terms of feature types and the values that each feature contains.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">str</span>(iris)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## &#39;data.frame&#39;:    150 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
##  $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
##  $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
##  $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
##  $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...</code></pre>
<p>Note that for big datasets, the computation time will be substantially longer.</p>
