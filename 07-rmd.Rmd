# R Markdown

RMarkdown is a framework that provides a literate programming format for data science. It can be used to save and execute R code within RStudio, and also is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, ODT, RTF, and MS Word documents.

An RMarkdown is a plain text file that contains three different aspects:

- YAML metadata
- Text 
- Code Chunks 

## YAML Metadata 

YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language, and is used to specify document configurations and properties such as name, date, output format, etc. The (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s.

You can also include additional formatting [options](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html), such as a table of contents, or even custom CSS which can utilized to further enhance presentation. For the purpose of the class, the default options should be sufficient.  

The default output above is an html_document format. However, this can be specified as well, such as `pdf_document`. Before, you must install a TeX distribution such as [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/2.9/setup). You can also include raw LaTeX and even define LaTeX macros. Check [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html) to learn more about pdf document output. Check below to see an example of RMarkdown as pdf output.

To make your sections numbered as sections and subsections, make sure you specify `number_sections: yes` as part of YAML Metadata.

## Text 

In addition, due to its literate nature, text will be an essential part in explaining your analysis. With RMarkdown, we can specify custom text formatting, such as with emphasis such as *italics*, **bold**, or even a `code style`. Headings are preceded with a #, breaks create a new paragraph.

There are many more elements to creating a useful report using RMarkdown, and we encourage you to use the [Rmarkdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) as a reference. 

## Code Chunks 

This is where you enter your code. 

You can quickly insert chunks like these into your file with

- the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)
- the Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar
- by typing the chunk delimiters ```{r} and ```.

Like third code chunk above, we can also set up chunk options. Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. This is a useful way to embed figures. More options can be referred from the [Rmarkdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).

## Render Output 

After you are done, run `rmarkdown::render()` or click the `knit HTML` button at the top of the RStudio scripts pane to save the output in your working directory.
