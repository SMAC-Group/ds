In this chapter, we will as an example the function sin(x) in the range \\(0, 2\\pi)\\). nb_points &lt;- 60 x &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 4*pi, length.out = nb_points) y &lt;- sin(x) plot(x, y) In general, we found that the following approach is quite usefull, Step 1: Construct graph “frame”, i.e. basically an empty graph with the right title, labels, axis and so on. Often, this can be achieve with plot(). It is also useful to grid. Here is an example: plot(NA, xlim = range(x), ylim = range(y), main = &quot;my title&quot;, xlab = &quot;my xlab&quot;, ylab = &quot;my ylab&quot;, col.main = &quot;red&quot;, col.lab = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, col.axis = &quot;darkblue&quot;, cex.main = 2, cex.lab = 1, cex.axis = 0.5) grid() full link "]

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. When you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 7.1 Including Plots You can also embed plots, for example: Note that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
