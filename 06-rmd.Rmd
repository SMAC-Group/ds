# R Markdown

RMarkdown is a framework that provides a literate programming format for data science. It can be used to save and execute R code within RStudio, and also is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, ODT, RTF, and MS Word documents.

An RMarkdown is a plain text file that contains three different aspects:

- YAML metadata
- Text 
- Code Chunks 

## YAML Metadata 

YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language, and is used to specify document configurations and properties such as name, date, output format, etc. The (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s.

You can also include additional formatting [options](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html), such as a table of contents, or even custom CSS which can utilized to further enhance presentation. For the purpose of the class, the default options should be sufficient.  

## Text 

In addition, due to its literate nature, text will be an essential part in explaining your analysis. With RMarkdown, we can specify custom text formatting, such as with emphasis such as *italics*, **bold**, or even a `code style`. Headings are preceded with a #, breaks create a new paragraph.

There are many more elements to creating a useful report using RMarkdown, and we encourage you to use the [Rmarkdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) as a reference. 



## Code Chunks

By effectively 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
