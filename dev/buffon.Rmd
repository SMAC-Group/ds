## Example: Buffon's needle

In 1777, the French nobleman Georges-Louis Leclerc, Compte de Buffon (Count of Buffon) posed the following problem to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris [@buffon1777essai]:

> Suppose that you drop a needle of unit length on a plane ruled by the lines $y = m \; (m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, ...)$ - what is then the probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines?

Compte de Buffon also provided the answer and showed that the needle will intersect lines with a predictable probability. In mathematical terms, his solution (still known today as the Buffon principle) can be stated as follows:

\begin{equation} 
\mathbb{P}(\text{intersection}) = \frac{2}{\pi}.
(\#eq:probbuffon)
\end{equation}

```{block2, type='rmdtip'}
This proof is based on the solution of Example 4.5.8 of @grimmett2001probability. We start by letting $(X, Y)$ denote the coordinates of the point at the center of the needle and let $\Theta$ be the angle, modulo $\pi$, that lies between the needle and the horizontal lines. Next, we define the distance from the needle's center to the nearest line beneath it as $Z = Y -  \lfloor Y \rfloor$, where $\lfloor Y \rfloor$ denotes the "floor" of $Y$, i.e. the greatest integer not greater than $Y$. Since the needle is randomly casted, we have that the joint density of $(Z, \Theta)$ is given by:

\[
f_{Z, \Theta} (z, \theta) = f_{Z} (z) f_{\Theta} (\theta) = \frac{1}{\pi},
\]

for $0 \leq z \leq 1$ and $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$. By drawing a diagram one can see that an interception occurs if and only if $(Z, \Theta) \in \mathcal{B}$, where

\[
\mathcal{B} = \left\{(z, \theta)\,: \;\; z \leq \frac{1}{2} \sin (\theta)  \;\; \text{or} \;\; 1-z \leq \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)\right\}.
\]

Therefore, we obtain

\[
\mathbb{P}(\text{intersection}) = \iint_\mathcal{B} \; f_{Z, \Theta} (z, \theta)\, dz \, d\theta = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^\pi \left(\int_0^{\frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)} dz + \int_{1 - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)}^{1} dz \right) d\theta = \frac{2}{\pi},
\]

which verifies Equation \@ref(eq:probbuffon) and concludes the proof.

Georges-Louis Leclerc's motivation behind this problem was to design an experiment to estimate the value of $\pi$. Indeed, if you fling a needle a large number $B$ times onto a ruled plane and count the number of times $S_B$ that the needle intersects a line, we might be able to approximate $\mathbb{P}(\text{intersection})$ and therefore $\pi$. From Equation \@ref(eq:probbuffon), we know that the proportion $S_B/B$ will be "close" to the probability $\mathbb{P}(\text{intersection})$. In fact the (weak) law of large number garantees that $S_B/B$ converges (in probability) to $2/\pi$, i.e. for any given $\varepsilon > 0$,

\[
\lim_{B \rightarrow \infty} \; \mathbb{P}\left( \left| \frac{S_B}{B} - \frac{2}{\pi} \right|  > \varepsilon \right) = 0.
\]

Thus, the estimator

\[
\hat{\pi}_B = \frac{2B}{S_B},
\]

is a plausible estimator of $\pi$. The Continous Mapping Theorem [see e.g. Theorem 1.14 of @dasgupta2008asymptotic] can (among others) be used to show that $\hat{\pi}$ is a **consistent** estimator of $\pi$ (i.e. $\hat{\pi}$ converges in probability to $\pi$). In 1777, Georges-Louis Leclerc investigated this problem and computed $\hat{\pi}_B$ by flinging a needle 2084 times, which may consitute the first recorded example of a Monte-Carlo method (simulation?) in use.

To illustrate the convergence of our estimator we could fling a needle $B$ times and compute the following estimators:

\[
\hat{\pi}_j = \frac{2j}{S_j}, \;\; j = k,\, ...., \,B
\]

where $k \ll B$. Once this is done, we could create a graph with $j$ on the horizontal axis and $\hat{\pi}_j$ on the vertical axis. Since $\hat{\pi}_B$ is a consistent estimator we should see that $\hat{\pi}_j$ tends to get closer and closer to $\pi$ as $j$ increases. In this graph we could also superimpose several experiments (recasting the needle $B$ times several times) to reinforce our argument.

The goal of this example is to create a Shiny app to visualize and illustrate Buffon's needle experiment. For this purpose, we will use the following steps:

1) **Step 1: Backend**: Create all the functions needed for the backend of our app. A possible approach is to create the following functions:
    a) `cast_needle()`: this function randomly casts a needle on plane and returns its coordinates as well as a binary variable to indicate if the needle crossed a line;
    b) `buffon_experiment()`: this function performs a Monte-Carlo experiment by flinging a large number of needles using the function `cast_needle()`;
    c) `plot.buffon_experiment()`: to visualize the experiment (i.e. show all the needles randomly dropped) and compute the estimator $\hat{\pi}_B$ for the experiment at hand;
d) `converge()`: to illustrate the convergence of the estimator by creating the graph mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph.
2)  **Step 2: Frontend**: Create widgets to collect all inputs needed by the backend:
    a) dimension of the plane on which the needles are dropped;
    b) the number of needles being used, i.e. $B$;
    c) number of experiments which is needed to illustrate the convergence of the estimator; 
    d) the seed to allow "replicable" experiments.
Aside from allowing the user to enter these variables, we will need to create two output "tabs". In the first one, we will "print" the result(s) of the experiment and in the second one we will illustrate the convergence of the estimator. Finally, we will need a button to "run" a new experiment.

3) **Step 3: Connecting frontend and backend**: In this third step we will need to connect the inputs with the outputs. Indeed, we will use the `input` list created by the widget defined in the previous step (Step 2) to create the graphs to be displayed in the two output tabs. We will also need to "activate" the button (i.e. connect the inputs to the appropriate functions) in order to run a new experiment and update the "seed" after every new experiment.

To summarize, our approach should follow the steps presented in the chart below:

In the next sections, we will discuss in detail how to program each step.

### Step 1: Backend

Let us start with the function `cast_needle()`. This function has a single input, i.e. the width of the (square) plane on which the needle is cast and returns a `list` containing:

- `$start`: the coordinates of one end of the needle;
- `$end`: the coordinates of the other end of the needle;
- `$cross`: a binary variable to indicate if the needle intercepts a line.

```{block2, type='rmdnote'}
An additional input could be added consisting in the length of the needle. However, in this example we only consider needles of unit length.
```

A possible implementation of this function is given below:

```{r}
cast_needle <- function(plane_width = 20){
  available_range <- plane_width/2 - 1 # where 1 is the length of the needle (unit)
  x_start <- runif(2, -available_range, available_range)
  angle <- runif(1, 0, 2*pi)
  x_end <- c(cos(angle), sin(angle)) + x_start # where the angles are multiplied by the needle length which is 1 in this example
  cross <- floor(x_start[2]) != floor(x_end[2])
  out <- list(start = x_start, end = x_end, cross = cross)
  out
}
```

Here is an example of the output of this function:

```{r}
needle <- cast_needle(plane_width = 4)
needle
```

and we could now for example provide the following graphical representation of this random cast:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=5.5, fig.height=5.2}
plot(NA, xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(-2, 2), xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
abline(h = -2:2, lty = 3)
lines(c(needle$start[1], needle$end[1]), c(needle$start[2], needle$end[2]))
```

Next, we consider the function `buffon_experiment()`. This function is based on the previous function and contains the following inputs:

- `B`: the number of needles being casted;
- `plane_width`: the width of the (square) plane on which the needles are casted;
- `seed`: the "seed" used by the random number generator (allows to replicate results);

and returns a `list` containing:

- `$start`: a $B \times 2$ matrix containing the coordinates of one end of the $B$ needles;
- `$end`: a $B \times 2$ matrix containing the coordinates of the other end of the $B$ needles;
- `$cross`: a vector of length $B$ containing boolean variables to indicate whether a needle crosses a line or not;
- `$plane`: the width of the (square) plane.

A possible implementation of this function is provided below:

```{r}
buffon_experiment <- function(B = 2084, plane_width = 10, seed = NULL){
  
  if (!is.null(seed)){
    set.seed(seed)
  }
  
  X_start <- X_end <- matrix(NA, B, 2) 
  cross <- rep(NA, B)
  
  for (i in 1:B){
    inter <- cast_needle(plane_width = plane_width)
    X_start[i, ] <- inter$start
    X_end[i, ] <- inter$end
    cross[i] <- inter$cross
  }
  
  out <- list(start = X_start, end = X_end, cross = cross, plane = plane_width)
  class(out) <- "buffon_experiment"
  out
}
```

For example, if we consider an experiment where four needles are cast, we could obtain:

```{r}
experiment <- buffon_experiment(B = 4, plane_width = 4)
experiment
```

which could be represented as

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=5.5, fig.height=5.2}
plot(NA, xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(-2, 2), xlab = "x", ylab = "y")
abline(h = -2:2, lty = 3)
for (i in 1:4){
  lines(c(experiment$start[i,1], experiment$end[i,1]), 
        c(experiment$start[i,2], experiment$end[i,2]))
}
```

We can now write a custom `plot()` function for the output of the function `buffon_experiment()`. This function will provide a way to visualize the experiment and will compute $\hat{\pi}_B$, which will be shown in the title. A possible function is provided below:

```{r}
plot.buffon_experiment <- function(obj){
  cross <- obj$cross
  X_start <- obj$start
  X_end <- obj$end
  B <- length(cross)
  cols <- rev(hcl(h = seq(15, 375, length = 3), l = 65, c = 100)[1:2])
  
  title_part1 <- 'Buffon\'s needle experiment  -  '
  title_part2 <- ' = '
  pi_hat <- round(2/mean(obj$cross), 6)
  
  title <- bquote(.(title_part1) ~ hat(pi)[B] ~ .(title_part2) ~ .(pi_hat))
  
  plot(NA, xlab = "x", ylab = "y", xlim = c(-obj$plane/2, obj$plane/2), 
       ylim = c(-obj$plan/2, obj$plan/2), 
       main = title)
  abline(h = (-obj$plan):obj$plan, lty = 3)
  
  for (i in 1:B){
    lines(c(X_start[i,1], X_end[i,1]), c(X_start[i,2], X_end[i,2]), 
          col = cols[cross[i] + 1])
  }
}
```

Therefore, we could now run the same experiment as Georges-Louis Leclerc by flinging 2084 needles almost instanteously (which is the default value in the `buffon_experiment()` function we created):

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5.2}
experiment <- buffon_experiment(B = 2084)
plot(experiment)
```

Finally, we can consider the function `converge()`. Similarly to `buffon_experiment()`, the function `converge()` has the following inputs:

- `B`: the number of needles being cast;
- `plane_width`: the width of the (square) plane on which the needles are cast;
- `seed`: the "seed" used by the random number generator (allows to replicate results);
- `M`: the number of experiments.

The function returns the graph mentioned at the end of the previous section. A possible implementation of this function is provided below:

```{r}
converge <- function(B = 2084, plane_width = 10, seed = 1777, M = 12){
  
  if (B < 10){
    warning("B was changed to 10")
    B <- 10
  }
  
  pi_hat <- matrix(NA, B, M)
  trials <- 1:B
  cols <- rev(hcl(h = seq(15, 375, length = (M+1)), 
                 l = 65, c = 100, alpha = 1)[1:M])
  set.seed(seed)
  
  for (i in 1:M){
    cross <- buffon_experiment(B = B, plane_width = plane_width)$cross
    pi_hat[,i] <- 2*trials/cumsum(cross)
  }
  
  plot(NA, xlim = c(1,B), ylim = pi + c(-3/4, 3/4), type = "l", col = "darkblue",
       ylab = bquote(hat(pi)[j]),
       xlab = "j", main = "Buffon\'s needle experiment")
  grid()
  
  for (i in 1:M){
    lines(trials, pi_hat[,i], col = cols[i])
  }
  
  abline(h = pi, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
}
```

Therefore, if we were to repeat the original experiment of Georges-Louis Leclerc 20 times and compute $\hat{\pi}_j$ for each experiment we would obtain:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=5.2}
converge(B = 2084, M = 20, seed = 10)
```

which provides some illustrations on the convergence of the estimator.

### Step 2: Frontend

We start by constructing an "empty" Shiny app, i.e.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Define UI for application
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Application title
  titlePanel(h4("Buffon\'s needle experiment - Inputs:")),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      # Add inputs here!
    ),
    
    mainPanel(
      tabsetPanel(
        # Add tabs here!
      )
    )
  )
)

# Define server
server <- function(input, output) {
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

If you run this empty app you should obtain the result below:

<center>
![](images/shiny_ui_part1.png)
</center>

We will start by adding the required input widgets by modifying the `ui` function as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Define UI for application
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Application title
  titlePanel(h4("Buffon\'s needle experiment - Inputs:")),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      numericInput("plane", "Plane width:", 6, 10, 100),
      numericInput("B", "Number of trials:", 100, 20, 10^6),
      numericInput("M", "Number of experiments:", 1, 1, 100),
      numericInput("seed", "Simulation seed", 1777, 1, 1000000),
      actionButton("cast", "Let's cast some needles!", icon = icon("thumbs-up"))
    ),
    
    mainPanel(
      tabsetPanel(
        # Add tabs here!
      )
    )
  )
)
```

By running this update you should now obtain:

<center>
![](images/shiny_ui_part2.png)
</center>

Next, we create two output tabs in which we will find the previously mentioned graphs. This can be done by again modifying the `ui`function as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Define UI for application
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  # Application title
  titlePanel(h4("Buffon\'s needle experiment - Inputs:")),
  
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      numericInput("plane", "Plane width:", 6, 10, 100),
      numericInput("B", "Number of trials:", 100, 20, 10^6),
      numericInput("M", "Number of experiments:", 1, 1, 100),
      numericInput("seed", "Simulation seed", 1777, 1, 1000000),
      actionButton("cast", "Let's cast some needles!", icon = icon("thumbs-up"))
    ),
    
    mainPanel(
      tabsetPanel(
        tabPanel("Experiment", plotOutput("exp")),
        tabPanel("Convergence", plotOutput("conv"))
      )
    )
  )
)
```

The app should now look like this:

<center>
![](images/shiny_ui_part3.png)
</center>

At this point, we have completed the `ui` function and will modify the `server` in the next section.

### Step 3: Connecting frontend and backend

In this section, we will focus on the `server` function to produce the desired output. Let us start by "connecting" our output tabs defined in the `ui` function with the output in the server function. Since both outputs are graphs, we will use the function `renderPlot()` as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$exp <- renderPlot({
    # Add graph 1 here!
  }, height = 620)
  
  output$conv <- renderPlot({
    # Add graph 2 here!
  }, height = 620)
}
```

If you re-run the app at this point our changes will have no visible effect. Next, we will focus on the first graph based on the functions `buffon_experiment()` and `plot.buffon_experiment()`. The first thing we will need is to (re-)run the `buffon_experiment()` when the user clicks on the "action" button. This can be done by adding the following lines to the `server` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cast <- eventReactive(input$cast, {
    buffon_experiment(B = input$B, plane_width = input$plane, 
                      seed = input$seed)
  })
```

When this function is (re-)evaluated we want to update/create the first plot, which can be done by replacing the following part of the `server` function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$exp <- renderPlot({
    # Add graph 1 here!
}, height = 620)
```

with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$exp <- renderPlot({
    plot(cast())
}, height = 620)
```

Therefore, your `server` function should now be:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # Fling some needles!
  cast <- eventReactive(input$cast, {
    buffon_experiment(B = input$B, plane_width = input$plane, 
                      seed = input$seed)
  })
  
  output$exp <- renderPlot({
    plot(cast())
  }, height = 620)
  
  output$conv <- renderPlot({
    # Add graph 2 here!
  }, height = 620)
}
```

and when reloading the app you should now see:

<center>
![](images/shiny_server_part1.png)
</center>

Similarly, we do the same thing for the second graph by adding the following lines to our `server` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
conv <- eventReactive(input$cast, {
    converge(B = input$B, plane_width = input$plan, 
             seed = input$seed, M = input$M)
})
```

and replacing 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$conv <- renderPlot({
    # Add graph 2 here!
}, height = 620)
```

with 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output$conv <- renderPlot({
    conv()
}, height = 620)
```

After these changes, your `server` function should look like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # Fling some needles!
  cast <- eventReactive(input$cast, {
    buffon_experiment(B = input$B, plane_width = input$plane, 
                      seed = input$seed)
  })
  
  conv <- eventReactive(input$cast, {
    converge(B = input$B, plane_width = input$plane, 
             seed = input$seed, M = input$M)
  })
  
  output$exp <- renderPlot({
    plot(cast())
  }, height = 620)
  
  output$conv <- renderPlot({
    conv()
  }, height = 620)
}
```

and when reloading the app you should now see on the second tab:

<center>
![](images/shiny_server_part2.png)
</center>

Our next step is now to update the seed every time the "action" button is pushed. To do so, we will first need to add an additional input to the `server` function called `session` which will allow us to **dynamically** update the input directly from the `server` function. Therefore, in order to randomly generate a new seed each time the user clicks on the "action" button, we can do the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
observeEvent(input$cast,{
    updateNumericInput(session, "seed", 
                       value = round(runif(1, 1, 10^4)))
})
```

Therefore, your final `server` function is now:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  observeEvent(input$cast,{
    updateNumericInput(session, "seed", 
                       value = round(runif(1, 1, 10^4)))
  })
  
  # Fling some needles!
  cast = eventReactive(input$cast, {
    buffon_experiment(B = input$B, plane_width = input$plane, 
                      seed = input$seed)
  })
  
  conv = eventReactive(input$cast, {
    converge(B = input$B, plane_width = input$plane, 
             seed = input$seed, M = input$M)
  })
  
  output$exp <- renderPlot({
    plot(cast())
  }, height = 620)
  
  output$conv <- renderPlot({
    conv()
  }, height = 620)
}
```

With this change, you will now observe that the seed is updated each time the "action" button is clicked. The final version of the app we have just created can be found [here](http://shiny.science.psu.edu/szg279/buffon/).
