We want to take some input, such as parameters, and produce output. In this chapter we will build the shiny applicaion building procedure. 7.1.1 Step 1. R Code / Server / Backend Before we start thinking of the web application, we want to focus on the R Code, or also commonly known as the “backend” of the application. For all the intended operations to work in the application we need to make sure that the R code that serves as the skeleton operates in the way the developer want it to be. For example, perhaps we are trying to build an application that builds a histogram from the waiting time of the default R dataset, Old Faithful Geyser Dataset. We also want to add an option for controlling the number of bins. For this to work, we want to build the histogram in R and test out to see if the output is what was desired initially. Below we create the default histogram. x &lt;- faithful[, 2] hist(x) Now we want to make sure to later add the option of creating more bins so the graph is customizable. In the hist() function, we see an option breaks that we can use to take in different inputs based on what the client wants. par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # Compare the differences! bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 10) hist(x, breaks = bins) bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 20) hist(x, breaks = bins) 7.1.2 Step 2: User Interface (UI) / Frontend The previous information goes into a part called the “server” in the shiny application. Now we want to focus on the frontend of the application, the things we “see” and options we can interact with when we open the app. 7.1.2.1 Content Creation We want to design what the application so that it is comprehensive and easy to interpret. Below are some often used options of content creation that will be beneficial to know. Function Description titlePanel() The title of the application sidebarLayout() Creates a sidebar layout for fluidPage() 7.1.2.2 Input Controls We also want to provide space so the client can change any desired parameter. In the example explained above, this would be the number of bins. Below are some input controls the developer can use. Function Description numericInput() Number entry input radioButtons() Radio button selection selectInput() Dropdown menu sliderInput() Range slider (1/2 values) submitButton() Submission button textInput() Text input box checkboxInput() Single checkbox input dateInput() Date Selection input fileInput() Upload a file to Shiny helpText() Describe input field sidebarPanel() | Makes a sidebar menu | mainPanel() | Main content area for different output | 7.1.2.3 Output Render Controls The different type of output that is shown can be designed depending on what the developer intends it to be. Examples of these options are shown below. We advise you to follow the videos and research different options that fit the desired output. Function Description plotOutput() Display a rendered plot tableOutput() Display in Table textOutput() Formatted Text Output uiOutput() Dynamic UI Elements verbatimTextOutput() “as is”&quot; Text Output“ imageOutput() Render an Image htmlOutput() Render Pure HTML 7.1.3 Step 3: Connecting frontend and backend 7.2 Example: Monte-Carlo Integration ??? 7.3 Example: Buffon’s needle In 1777, the French nobleman Georges-Louis Leclerc, Compte de Buffon posed the following problem to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris (Georges-Louis Leclerc 1777): Suppose that you drop a needle of unit length on a plane ruled by the lines \\(y = m \\; (m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...)\\) - what is then the probability that the needle comes to lie in a position where it crosses one of the lines? Compte de Buffon also provided the answer and showed that the needle will intersect lines with a predictable probability. In mathematical terms, his solution (still known today as the Buffon principle) can be stated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbb{P}(\\text{intersection}) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}. \\tag{7.1} \\end{equation}\\] If you are curious about the derivation of this result, click on the button below. Derivation - Equation (7.1) This proof is based on the solution of Example 4.5.8 of Grimmett and Stirzaker (2001). We start by letting the point \\((X, Y)\\) denote the coordinates of the center of the needle and let \\(\\Theta\\) be the angle, modulo \\(\\pi\\), made by the needle and the horizontal axis. Next, we define the distance from the needle’s center to the nearest line beneath it by \\(Z = Y - \\lfloor Y \\rfloor\\), where \\(\\lfloor Y \\rfloor\\) denotes the “floor” of \\(Y\\), i.e. the greatest integer not greater than \\(Y\\). Since the needle is randomly casted we have that the joint density of \\((Z, \\Theta)\\) is given by: \\[ f_{Z, \\Theta} (z, \\theta) = f_{Z} (z) f_{\\Theta} (\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}, \\] for \\(0 \\leq z \\leq 1\\) and \\(0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi\\). By drawing a diagram one can see that an interception occurs if and only if \\((Z, \\Theta) \\in \\mathcal{B}\\), where \\[ \\mathcal{B} = \\left\\{(z, \\theta)\\,: \\;\\; z \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\sin (\\theta) \\;\\; \\text{or} \\;\\; 1-z \\leq \\frac{1}{2} \\sin(\\theta)\\right\\}. \\] Therefore, we obtain \\[ \\mathbb{P}(\\text{intersection}) = \\iint_\\mathcal{B} \\; f_{Z, \\Theta} (z, \\theta)\\, dz \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi \\left(\\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\theta)} dz + \\int_{1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(\\theta)}^{1} dz \\right) d\\theta = \\frac{2}{\\pi}, \\] which verifies Equation (7.1) and concludes the proof. Georges-Louis Leclerc motivation behind this problem was to design an experiment to estimate the value of \\(\\pi\\). Indeed, if you fling a needle a large number \\(B\\) times onto a ruled plane and count the number of times \\(S_B\\) that the needle intersects a line we might be able to approximate \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\text{intersection})\\) and therefore \\(\\pi\\). From Equation (7.1), we know that the proportion \\(S_B/B\\) will be “close” to the probability \\(\\mathbb{P}(\\text{intersection})\\). In fact the (weak) law of large number garantees that \\(S_B/B\\) converges (in probability) to \\(2/\\pi\\), i.e. for any given \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\), \\[ \\lim_{B \\rightarrow \\infty} \\; \\mathbb{P}\\left( \\left| \\frac{S_B}{B} - \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\right| &gt; \\varepsilon \\right) = 0. \\] Thus, the estimator \\[ \\hat{\\pi}_B = \\frac{2B}{S_B}, \\] is a plausible estimator of \\(\\pi\\). The Continous Mapping Theorem (see e.g. Theorem 1.14 of DasGupta 2008) can (among other) be used to show that \\(\\hat{\\pi}\\) is a consistent estimator of \\(\\pi\\) (i.e. \\(\\hat{\\pi}\\) converges in probability to \\(\\pi\\)). In 1777, Georges-Louis Leclerc investigated this problem and computed \\(\\hat{\\pi}_B\\) by flinging a needle 2084 times, which may consitute the first recorded example of a Monte-Carlo method (simulation?) in use. To illustarte the convergence of our estimator we could fling \\(B\\) times a needle and compute the following estimators: \\[ \\hat{\\pi}_j = \\frac{2j}{S_j}, \\;\\; j = k,\\, ...., \\,B \\] where \\(k \\ll B\\). Then, we could create a graph with \\(j\\) on horizontal axis and \\(\\hat{\\pi}_j\\) on the horizontal axis. Since \\(\\hat{\\pi}_B\\) is a consistent estimator we should see that \\(\\hat{\\pi}_j\\) tends to get closer and closer to \\(\\pi\\) as \\(j\\) increase. In this graph we could also superimpose several experiments (recasting the needle \\(B\\) times several times) to reinforce our argument. The goal of this example is to create a shiny app to vizualize and illustarte Buffon’s needle experiment. For this purpose, we will use the following steps: Backend: Create all the functions needed for the backend of our app. A possible approach is to create the following functions: a function to cast one needle, a function to cast \\(B\\) needles, a function to vizualise the experiment (i.e. show the plane with the needles) and compute \\(\\hat{\\pi}_B\\) for the experiment at end, a function to illustrate the convergence of the estimator. 7.3.1 Step 1: R Code / Server / Backend In this section, we will construct the following four functions: cast_needle() this function randomly casts a needle on plane and returns its coordoniates as well as a binary variable to indicate if the needle crossed a line. buffon_experiment() this function performs a Monte-Carlo experiment by flinging a large number of needles using the function cast_needle(). plot.buffon_experiment()…. converge() Let us start with the function cast_needle(). This function has a single input, i.e. the width of the (square) plane on which the needle is casted and returns a list containing: $start: the coordinates of the one end of the needle, $end: the coordinates of the other end of the needle, $cross: a binary variable to indicate if the needle intercepts a line. A possible implementation of this function is given below: cast_needle = function(plane_width = 20){ needle_length = 1 available_range = plane_width/2 - needle_length x_start = runif(2, -available_range, available_range) angle = runif(1, 0, 2*pi) x_end = needle_length*c(cos(angle), sin(angle)) + x_start cross = floor(x_start[2]) != floor(x_end[2]) out = list(start = x_start, end = x_end, cross = cross) out } Here is an example of the output of function: needle = cast_needle(plane_width = 4) needle ## $start ## [1] 0.7731200 -0.3701612 ## ## $end ## [1] 1.67615251 0.05941108 ## ## $cross ## [1] TRUE and we could now for example provide the following graphical representation of this random cast: plot(NA, xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(-2, 2), xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;) abline(h = -2:2, lty = 3) lines(c(needle$start[1], needle$end[1]), c(needle$start[2], needle$end[2])) Next, we consider the function buffon_experiment(). This function is based on function the previous function and contains the following inputs: B: the number of needles being casted, plane_width: the width of the (square) plane on which the needles are casted, seed: the “seed” used by the random number generator (allows to replicate results), and returns a list containing: $start: a \\(B \\times 2\\) matrix containing the coordinates of the one end of the \\(B\\) needles, $end: a \\(B \\times 2\\) matrix containing the coordinates of the other end of the \\(B\\) needles, $cross: a vector of length \\(B\\) containing boolean variables to indicate the crossing the each needle, $plane: the width of the (square) plane. A possible implementation of this function is provided below: buffon_experiment = function(B = 2084, plane_width = 10, seed = NULL){ if (!is.null(seed)){ set.seed(seed) } X_start = X_end = matrix(NA, B, 2) cross = rep(NA, B) for (i in 1:B){ inter = cast_needle(plane_width = plane_width) X_start[i, ] = inter$start X_end[i, ] = inter$end cross[i] = inter$cross } out = list(start = X_start, end = X_end, cross = cross, plane = plane_width) class(out) = &quot;buffon_experiment&quot; out } For example, if we consider an experiment where one cast four needles we could obtain: experiment = buffon_experiment(B = 4, plane_width = 4) experiment ## $start ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] -0.3309261 -0.1229158 ## [2,] 0.3010591 -0.2870966 ## [3,] 0.9023766 0.1894991 ## [4,] -0.3495219 -0.7255560 ## ## $end ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] -0.2966345 0.8764961 ## [2,] 0.3405430 0.7121236 ## [3,] 1.3148555 -0.7214680 ## [4,] -1.1584575 -1.3134532 ## ## $cross ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ## ## $plane ## [1] 4 ## ## attr(,&quot;class&quot;) ## [1] &quot;buffon_experiment&quot; which could be represented as plot(NA, xlim = c(-2, 2), ylim = c(-2, 2), xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;) abline(h = -2:2, lty = 3) for (i in 1:4){ lines(c(experiment$start[i,1], experiment$end[i,1]), c(experiment$start[i,2], experiment$end[i,2])) } We can now write a custom plot() function for the output of the function buffon_experiment(). This function will provide a way to vizualize the experiment and will compute \\(\\hat{\\pi}_B\\), which will be show in the title. A possible function is provided below: plot.buffon_experiment = function(obj){ cross = obj$cross X_start = obj$start X_end = obj$end B = length(cross) cols = rev(hcl(h = seq(15, 375, length = 3), l = 65, c = 100)[1:2]) titre_part1 = &#39;Buffon\\&#39;s needle experiment - &#39; titre_part2 = &#39; = &#39; pi_hat = round(2/mean(obj$cross), 6) titre = bquote(.(titre_part1) ~ hat(pi)[B] ~ .(titre_part2) ~ .(pi_hat)) plot(NA, xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;, xlim = c(-obj$plane/2, obj$plane/2), ylim = c(-obj$plan/2, obj$plan/2), main = titre) abline(h = (-obj$plan):obj$plan, lty = 3) for (i in 1:B){ lines(c(X_start[i,1], X_end[i,1]), c(X_start[i,2], X_end[i,2]), col = cols[cross[i] + 1]) } } Therefore, we could now run the same experiment as Georges-Louis Leclerc fliging 2084 needles almost instanteously: experiment = buffon_experiment(B = 2084) plot(experiment) Finally, we can consider the function converge() converge = function(B = 2084, plane_width = 10, seed = 1777, M = 12){ if (B &lt; 10){ warning(&quot;B was changed to 10&quot;) B = 10 } pi_hat = matrix(NA, B, M) trials = 1:B cols = rev(hcl(h = seq(15, 375, length = (M+1)), l = 65, c = 100, alpha = 1)[1:M]) set.seed(seed) for (i in 1:M){ cross = buffon_experiment(B = B, plane_width = plane_width)$cross pi_hat[,i] = 2*trials/cumsum(cross) } plot(NA, xlim = c(1,B), ylim = pi + c(-3/4, 3/4), type = &quot;l&quot;, col = &quot;darkblue&quot;, ylab = bquote(hat(pi)[i]), xlab = &quot;i&quot;, main = &quot;Buffon\\&#39;s needle experiment in time&quot;) grid() for (i in 1:M){ lines(trials, pi_hat[,i], col = cols[i]) } abline(h = pi, lwd = 2, lty = 2) } converge(B = 5*10^4, M = 4, seed = 10) What we want: inputs 2 tabs buttom to draw + update seed Placeholder "]
