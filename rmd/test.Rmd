Experiment with the Rmd Code below and test output.

* an asterisk starts an unordered list
* and this is another item in the list
+ or you can also use the + character
- or the - character

To start an ordered list, write this:

1. this starts a list *with* numbers
2. this will show as number '2.'
33. a wrong number here still shows as number '3.'
#. the '#' continues the list and shows as number '4.'
9. any number or '#' will keep the list going.
    * just indent by 4 spaces (or tab) to make a sub-list
        1. keep indenting for more sub lists
    * here i'm back to the second level
