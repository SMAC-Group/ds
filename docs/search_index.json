Command Description x &gt; y x greater than y x &gt;= y x greater or equals to y x &lt; y x less than y x &lt;= y x less than or equals to y x == y x equal to y x != y x not equal to y !x Not x x |y x or y x &amp; y x and y isTRUE(x) test if all of x is TRUE Logical operators can be applied to vectors as well. For example, here we create two random numerical vectors and compare them. x = c(3,6,3,4,5) y = c(2,3,4,5,6) x&gt;y ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE This method outputs a vector of boolean TRUE and FALSE values that perform element-wise comparisons. Note, this is called a vectorized method, which we will further mention in some detail later. isTRUE() checks if all the elements within the object is TRUE. isTRUE(TRUE) ## [1] TRUE isTRUE(x&gt;y) ## [1] FALSE "]
