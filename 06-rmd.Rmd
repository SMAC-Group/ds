# R Markdown

RMarkdown is a framework that provides a literate programming format for data science. It can be used to save and execute R code within RStudio, and also is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, ODT, RTF, and MS Word documents.

An RMarkdown is a plain text file that contains three different aspects:

- Code Chunks 
- Text 
- YAML metadata




## YAML Metadata 
YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language, and is used to specify document configurations and properties such as name, date, output format, etc.

## Text

## Code Chunks

By effectively 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
