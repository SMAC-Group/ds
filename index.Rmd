# Introduction



Explain what this text is about + objectives.

This chapter should summarize the advantage of using R. Following Hadley's Advanced R, here are the main points:

- Free, open source which implies easy results can easily be replicated.
- Massive set of packages
- Easy packages creation to allow code sharing
- Cutting edge tools (research in stat and machine learning often use R)
- Powerful tools for communicating results (Rmarkdown, shinny)
- Can be "connected" to high-performance languages. In this text, we will discuss C++ but C and FORTRAN are also natural candidates

Maybe add drawback of R, for me the main one is that R is slow and doesn't manages well memory. There are certainly other just as the inconsistency between packages.

It would be nice to add some kind of list of "what you should be able to do after reading this text".

Finally, a few remarks on conventions, references (this text will use a lot Hadley's books) and some acknowledgements.
