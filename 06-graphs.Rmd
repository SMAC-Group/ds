# Graphics {#chap:graphs}

In this chapter we discuss graphics with R.

In this chapter, we will as an example the function `sin(x)` in the range $0, 2\pi)$. 

```{r}
nb_points <- 60
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 4*pi, length.out = nb_points)
y <- sin(x)
plot(x, y)
```

In general, we found that the following approach is quite usefull, 

- Step 1: Construct graph "frame", i.e. basically an empty graph with the right title, labels, axis and so on. Often, this can be achieve with `plot()`. It is also useful to grid. Here is an example:

```{r}
plot(NA, xlim = range(x), ylim = range(y), main = "my title",
         xlab = "my xlab", ylab = "my ylab", col.main = "red", 
         col.lab = "darkgreen", col.axis = "darkblue", cex.main = 2,
         cex.lab = 1, cex.axis = 0.5)
grid()
```
