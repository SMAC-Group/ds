After plenty hours of hard work, you only find yourself saving the same file over and over - even losing track of what changes you made. Version control is a software that keeps track of your changes for you. 


## Version Control 

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time, so that you can save changes over time. It allows you to: 

- keep the entire history of a file 
- revert to a specific version of the file 
- collaborate on the same platform with other people 
- make changes without modifying the main file 


## Git and GitHub

Among version control platform, Git is a powerful tool that is commonly used. GitHub is a commercial website that uses Git and stores local files into a "album" called a repository. For the purposes of this course, we will be using this platform. 

In addition, your GitHub profile will also serve as your data science *resume* that contain future projects that you save and commit so that employers know what you're made of. 


## GitHub Setup 

To begin, head over to GitHub and sign up with your PSU email address. (don't worry, you can change your Username/Email anytime after this course!)

On `Step 2: Choose your plan` choose the default plan (Unlimited public repositories for free.) and click `Continue`. You can either submit your information or skip `Step 3: Tailor your experience`. 

Once you have set up your profile, make sure you send your user ID (eg. jjl170) to *****. 


## Configuration 

Before we start, you will need to associate configure your name and email address in Git.
