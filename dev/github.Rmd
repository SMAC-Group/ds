# GitHub 

When working on a report or a project, it is often the case that you keep separate versions either to keep track of the changes (in case you want to go back to a previous version) or to have a version for each person working on different parts of the project. As a result of this approach, you may have experienced a moment like this[^1] at least once in your life:

In these cases, after having modified and changed different parts of a report, you probably find yourself saving the same file over and over again while losing track of what changes you made. To respond to this problem, software has been developed to keep track of your changes by informing you on the saves you made and allowing you to go back to previous versions in order to revert those changes. This software is generally called "version control" and this chapter discusses the features of this software as well as introducing a specific version control platform called "GitHub". The latter includes a series of highly useful tools that can be extremely helpful, not only for the projects developed based on this book, but also for any personal or collaborative project you may undertake in the future. 

## Version Control 

As mentioned above, *version control* is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files in order to keep track and possibly revert to or modify those changes over time. More specifically, it allows you to: 

- record the entire history of a file;
- revert to a specific version of the file;
- collaborate on the same platform with other people;
- make changes without modifying the main file and add them once you feel comfortable with them. 

All these features are highly important when projects start becoming more complex and/or different collaborators contribute to it. In the next section we present a version control platform called "GitHub" that is commonly used among programmers and software developers thereby allowing them also to make their work visible and available to the general public. 

## Git and GitHub

Among the different version control platforms, Git is a commonly used and powerful tool that is made more accessible thtough GitHub which is a commercial website that uses this platform and stores local files into an "album" called a repository. For the purposes of this course, we will be using this platform. 

In addition, your GitHub profile will also serve as your data science *resume* that contain future projects that you save and commit so that employers know what you're made of. 


## Git Setup 

To install Git, go to the [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and choose the platform you are using. (eg. Windows/Mac/Linux/Solaris)


## Configuration 

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

```
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.

Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.


## GitHub Setup 

To begin, head over to GitHub and sign up with your PSU email address. (don't worry, you can change your Username/Email anytime after this course!)

On `Step 2: Choose your plan` choose the default plan (Unlimited public repositories for free.) and click `Continue`. You can either submit your information or skip `Step 3: Tailor your experience`. 

Once you have set up your profile, make sure you verify your email address. Also, send me your GitHub user ID (eg. jjl170) to `jjl170@psu.edu`. 

## Student Developer Pack

Once you have set up your profile, go to this [link](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) and follow the steps below to set up a student developer pack discount request to GitHub. You will need this to make your own private repositories for free.

I will add a tutorial to how to submit your homework and assignments using GitHub.
