Inline Code highlighting with `mean(x)`. 

```{r calculate_mean, cache = TRUE}
n = 25
set.seed(42)
x = runif(n) # Generates 25 random numbers

mean(x)
```

If you do not want code to run just use:
```r
mean(x)
```

We will talk more about plots later, but here is an example of changing plot figure options.

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```
